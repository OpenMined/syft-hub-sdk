These patterns may come from real-world data or from previous experiences in the form of patterns learned through trial and error. Neural networks consist of several layers of neurons, or nodes, connected together by weighted connections. Each layer of neurons has different weights, which determine how much input is passed to that neuron and how it affects the next layer of neurons.\n",
