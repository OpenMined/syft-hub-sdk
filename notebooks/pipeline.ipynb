      " Python is a widely popular programming language that has become increasingly popular in recent years. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility, making it a go-to choice for both beginners and experienced developers alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally developed at MIT in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, Python has gone on to become one of the most popular programming languages in use today. It has a strong focus on simplicity and is designed with efficiency, safety, and readability in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Python's core language design philosophy is based around simplicity and maintainability, with a clean syntax that encourages programmers to write fewer lines of code. This makes it an excellent choice for users who are new to programming or who may not have prior coding experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "One benefit of Python is that it has robust built-in libraries, including Python's standard library (which includes modules like 'csv', 're', and 'datetime') as well as many third-party libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and PyTorch. These libraries provide a wide range of functionalities that are necessary for various types of software development projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to its built-in functionality, Python also offers a vast library of third-party packages from the PyPi repository (Python Package Index) for various purposes. These include things like data science, natural language processing, machine learning, and more. With such a wide array of libraries available, Python is an excellent choice for users who want to develop their skills in one or more areas related to software development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Python has become increasingly popular because it offers a balance between simplicity and robustness, making it a great choice for developers seeking to create scalable, robust, and efficient software applications.\u001b[0m\n"

      " Machine learning (ML) is a type of AI that uses algorithms to learn from and improve upon data without being explicitly programmed. In ML, data is used to train models that can make predictions or recommendations based on their knowledge of the data. This process is often automated, meaning algorithms can continuously analyze new data and improve their predictions over time. \n",

      "In general, ML can be broken down into three main components: training data, model, and algorithm. The training data (also known as the \"training set\") contains the original data used to train the model. This data is typically labeled or tagged with relevant information such as categories or attributes. Once the training set is complete, the model can be created by using algorithms that fit the training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the modeling phase, algorithms will use a variety of techniques to analyze the data and develop predictions based on their knowledge. These predictions may be used to make decisions, recommendations, or other types of predictions in real-time or as predicted outcomes. The final output is called a \"model,\" which can be used for predictive analysis or decision-making purposes.\n",

      "Another important aspect of ML is the optimization process. This involves iterating through various models and selecting the best one based on performance metrics such as accuracy, error rate, or likelihood of prediction success.

      "The goal of an agent in AI is not just to act as a \"human\" in the context of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models, but also to have a clear understanding and reasoning about the inner working of such models. An agent's cognitive architecture, or how it operates, consists of three essential components: combinational reasoning, logic, and access to external information. These components help agents process information, make decisions, and take actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this whitepaper, we will introduce these components and the different types of agents that Generative AI models can build at the time of publication. In order to understand the inner working of an agent, let's first introduce the foundational components that drive the agent's behavior, actions, and decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combinational Reasoning: This is combination of reasoning, logic, and access to external information that are all connected to a Generative AI model invoke to support understanding the inner working of such models. Xie, M., (2022) suggests that in-context learning work, which involves observing the world and acting upon it using the tools that they have at their disposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scavenge Nearest Neighbors: This is a framework for understaning the differences from traditional supervised learning. Xie, M., (2022) presents this approach as a simple calculation with decision-making algorithms or implementing other probabilistic reasoning techniques. In the cognitive architecture of an agent, these components can be described as a Cognitive Architecture, and there are many such architectures that can be achieved by mixing and matching these components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent Orchestration Layers: This is a set of machine learning algorithms that work together to provide an intuitive user experience. In this whitepaper, we will discuss the specific implementation of each layer in the cognitive architecture section. Imagine a chef has received a specific prompt and a few key ingredients from a customer. The chef would need to figure out how to prepare the dishe or dish 'on the fly' that most closely matches the customer's original query.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fine-Tuning Based Learning: This is an example of this by retrieving information from external memory. An example of this in XAI models could be the 'Example Store' in Vertex AI extensions, or the data stores RAG based architecture mentioned previously. In general, Fine-Tuining-Based learning allows agents to learn and apply new tools before receiving any user queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cognitive Architecture: This is a comprehensive framework that helps agents understand and react to their environment. Xie, M., (2022) suggests that fine-tuining based learning is one of the essential components in this cognitive architecture. The goal is for agents to have access to additional tools before receiving any user queries, making it easier for them to apply specific knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model:\n",
      "In XAI models, the model refers to the langua and populates the model prompt with relevant information, tools, and associated examples by retrieving them from external memory. This helps the model understan how to apply certain tools prior to receiving any user queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model, however, is not a complete picture of an agent. Agents also use tools for reasoning, logic, and access to external information. For instance, in Figure 2, the model used a tool (Flights) to search for real-time external information based on the user's original query.\n",
      "\n",
      "In XAI models, the agent uses logic to make decisions based on its understanding of the inner working of the model and the tools it has at its disposal. Logic can help agents process information, make decisions, and take actions based on their knowledge. An example of this in Figure 2 is the use of combinational reasoning to provide intuitive user experiences.\n",

Xie suggests that fine-tuining based learning is one of the essential components in this cognitive architecture. The goal is for agents to have access to additional tools before receiving any user queries, making it easier for them to apply specific knowledge.
